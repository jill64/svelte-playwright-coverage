# üößWIP

Below is a draft.

## Installation

```sh
npm i -D svelte-playwright-coverage
```

## Setup

1. Add vite plugin to `vite.config.js`

```js
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { coverage } from 'svelte-playwright-coverage/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [sveltekit(), coverage()]
})
```

2. Use `svelte-playwright-coverage/test` instead of `@playwright/test` in your tests

```diff
- import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
+ import { test, expect } from 'svelte-playwright-coverage/test'
```

## Usage

Run test command with `spc`(**S**velte **P**laywright **C**overage)

```sh
spc playwright test
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> `spc` executes any command, but the following conditions must be met
>
> - The `playwright` test command should be executed.
> - The server to be used for testing must be started with `vite`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The `playwright` coverage API is currently [supported by Chromium-based browsers](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage).  
> If the test is run on a browser other than `chromium`, the test run will not be blocked, but a warning will be displayed in the console and no coverage will be collected.

If pass options to `spc`, before the test command.

```sh
spc --output coverage-result playwright test
```

## See more options

```sh
spc -h
```

## API

### Example

```js
import { spc } from 'svelte-playwright-coverage/spc'

const result = await spc('playwright test', {
  output: 'coverage-result'
})
```
